# review
Driver genes are vital for occurrence of cancer and an abnormal change of driver gene can be serious for human health and biomedical research. Therefore, identifying driver genes, exactly from massive genes with mutations, promotes the accurate diagnosis of disease and treatment of cancer. A lot of works about uncovering driver genes have been developed over the past decades. By analyzing massive previous works, we find that computational methods to distinguish driver genes from massive data are more efficient and faster than traditional biological experiments. In this study, we summarize thirteen common computational algorithms from different perspectives comprehensively. We first group multiple methods into four parts according to frequency, functional impact, clustering and others. Then, we conclude main processes of nominating candidate cancer driver genes for all methods. Finally, we evaluate five methods based on different theories by using five criteria on ten tumors mutation data derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program. Here, we focus more on presenting existing algorithms systematically and evaluating their performance from five perspectives, including Number of Driver Genes, CGC, OG/TSG, Q-value and QQ-plot. Furthermore, we provide a systematic view of these publicly available algorithms, so that many biologists and medical scienstists can choose their most interested direction preferentially to investigate further.
